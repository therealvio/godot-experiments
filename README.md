# godot-experiments

This repo contains individual Godot projects that are made up of one or more experiments with the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).

## Why?

The intention of this repository is to further my learning of Godot by focusing on specific things, or problems to solve rather than trying to make small games.

The benefits of creating small experiments are:

- Less expectation to fail or succeed (it's in the name: _experiments_!);
- Faster development cycles since a specific thing is being focused on;
- The outcomes of experiments can be potentially reused future projects I create; and
- Not getting caught up repeating the same things to otherwise make a small game that won't necessarily further learning.

## Future experiments to consider looking at

- Player movement types
- Gravity (falling down faster based on time, slower, e.t.c.)
- Using areas in a player area to change the behaviour of things (e.g. low gravity field, movement booster)
- Infinite scrolling side-scroller (not preserving the previous area)
- Motion Tracker
- Deeper dive into collisions
- Destructible objects
